/*
 * 
 * the values which are stored in variables are known as litrals.
 * 
 * the f is used because by default decimal values are stored in double format
 * so we declare f as float.
 * 
 * we dont have to use \n for new line here if we use a new system out it will
 * automatically comes in next line.
 * 
 * string can be used directly using string keyword in java
 * 
 * if we use (print) instead of (println) we dont get it in new line
